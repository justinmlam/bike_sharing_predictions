# Bike Sharing Predictions
As part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree, I was given a dataset and instructions to create a neural network to predict the usage of a bike sharing company.

## Description of Project
For this project, all files shown in this github repository were given to me, with empty sections for me to fill out. These sections are marked with a `# TODO` comment in my_answers.py, which I have kept and worked under.

### Tasks and Learning Opportunities
This project focused around creating a neural network (nn) from scratch and teaching the students the fundamental math and calculations behind what makes a nn run.

We had to create our own functions for the core blocks, such as:
  - activation functions
  - calculating forward pass, backpropagation, and updating weights through layers using matrices for inputs, weights, and outputs

Additionally, we were tasked to understand and set our own hyperparameters for the project. This included iteration count, learning rate, number of hidden nodes, and number of output nodes.

## Usage
To see the results, open Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb, a jupyter notebook that has been run and saved. This file calls upon methods imported from my_answers.py.
